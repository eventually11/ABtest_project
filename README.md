## AB Test Project Background

In this project, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of changes made to a specific feature in an online product through an A/B testing approach. The purpose of this test is to determine whether the new version of the feature (Version B) performs better than the current version (Version A) based on key metrics such as user engagement and conversion rates.



## Introduction to A/B Testing

A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a controlled experiment where a population is randomly divided into two or more groups. One group, referred to as the control group, remains exposed to the current version of a product or feature, while the other group, called the experimental group, is exposed to a modified or improved version of the feature. The objective is to compare the performance of the different versions and determine whether the experimental version leads to statistically significant improvements.

Principle:
The core principle of A/B testing is the control variable method. By ensuring that the only difference between the control group and the experimental group is the product version they experience, any differences in performance metrics (such as conversion rates or user engagement) can be attributed to the tested changes. This method ensures that all other variables, such as time and user demographics, remain consistent across the groups.

Hypothesis Testing:
A/B testing relies on hypothesis testing, which is a method used to determine whether the observed differences between the control and experimental groups are statistically significant or if they could be due to random chance. The most common hypothesis testing methods include the z-test, t-test, chi-square test, and F-test.

The idea is to ensure that the experimental results support or reject the hypothesis of the experiment. For example, if the hypothesis is that the experimental version will result in a higher conversion rate, the statistical tests will indicate whether any observed improvement is likely due to the experimental changes rather than random variations in user behavior.
